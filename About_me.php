            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px;"> My name is <strong>SHRIYANSH GUPTA</strong>. I am pursuing Master of Computer Application (MCA) at Dev Bhoomi Group of Institute,
                Dehradun. I was born in Shahjahanpur, in the state of Uttar Predesh, India, on oct 1, 1997. I belongs to a lower 
                middle-class family and had never experienced the luxury of traveling by car in his childhood. I am very simple person which have not any high level desire.
                My hobbies include coding and play Badminton. I actively participatein sports like Badminton, and run to keep fit. I love to listen to classical music as well as bollywood. I also enjoy watching movies and TV series.                
                I absolutely adore good food. I can generally be found in my room in front of my laptop. On the whole, I love to code and am an enthusiastic coder. In general, I am highly enthusiastic about learning new things
                and trying out new ideas. Life here is really exciting- working on new things, exploring new topics, and hearing new ideas every day. I am also an avid reader. 
                <br><br>
                In 2016, I started taking interest in computers &amp; internet, and I found it very 
                interesting thing to learn because the real world was turning very fast towards information technology. I started learning
                computer, because it was not end thus, I have little bit knowledge about computers and internet well equipped with enough 
                all knowledge in diverse fields. And this is the most valuable thing for me. Everyday is a new day for me as a learner and I try to learn at least one new thing every single day
                <br><br>
                I have just started my career, I donâ€™t have practical achievements, but I really want to practically explore and experience
                my potential by delivering the best services. And When I started work, I got a lot of problem because I did not have computer application background, then
                it started in the beginning that I did want to quit the computer application course but when I started 
                working for something, then complete it. This was my mind. It does not necessarily mean that the work will
                be done slowly. How to do programming was not a public, so I learned the C language And I started working on
                php language.So much problem happened But do not leave it to work. No work is difficult, just keep doing it.                  
                I believe patience and time management are my biggest strengths which are utmost essential at where i am stand like
                this. I am Hardworker, Punctual and good at interpersonal Relation as well as working in full
                night with a cup of coffee, which make is fresh mind. I am flexibile person, adaptability and desire to learn Everyday.
